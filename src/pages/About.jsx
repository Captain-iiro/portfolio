                in Djibouti. After much reflection with my family, I finally
                decided to take the engineering entrance exam. Thankfully for
                Allah, I was admitted, without fully knowing what awaited me
                there.

                Upon entering this faculty, I noticed that the program led to
                two options: civil engineering or electrical engineering. Since
                I only wanted to become a programmer, I asked the university
                dean if it was possible to pursue studies in a university that
                specialized in programming after completing the three general
                years. Unfortunately, he clearly stated that it was not
                possible. After one semester, I decided to leave the university,
                realizing that this path was not for me.
